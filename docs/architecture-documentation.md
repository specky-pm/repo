# Specky Repository Architecture Documentation

## 1. System Overview

The Specky Repository is a container for component specifications following the Specky format. It provides a centralized location for storing, retrieving, and managing component packages. The system is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use, with a focus on reliability and performance.

### 1.1 Purpose

The primary purpose of the Specky Repository is to:
- Store component specifications in a standardized format
- Provide easy access to component packages
- Support versioning of components
- Enable component discovery and reuse

### 1.2 Scope

The Specky Repository MVP is focused on the core functionality of component storage and retrieval. It includes:
- Component upload and validation
- Component download
- Component listing and version management
- Basic metadata management

## 2. System Architecture

The Specky Repository follows a layered architecture pattern, with clear separation of concerns between different components of the system.

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    Client[Client] -->|HTTP Requests| API[REST API Layer]
    API -->|Delegates| Service[Service Layer]
    Service -->|Data Access| Repository[Repository Layer]
    Repository -->|Persistence| Database[(PostgreSQL Database)]
```

### 2.2 Component Interactions

The system follows a typical request flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Controller
    participant Service
    participant Repository
    participant Database
    
    Client->>Controller: HTTP Request
    Controller->>Service: Process Request
    Service->>Repository: Data Operation
    Repository->>Database: Query/Update
    Database-->>Repository: Result
    Repository-->>Service: Data
    Service-->>Controller: Response Data
    Controller-->>Client: HTTP Response
```

### 2.3 Key Components

#### 2.3.1 REST API Layer

The REST API layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It includes:

- **ComponentController**: Handles component-related operations such as upload, download, and listing
- **Request/Response DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for API communication
- **Exception Handling**: Global exception handler for consistent error responses

#### 2.3.2 Service Layer

The service layer implements the business logic of the application. It includes:

- **ComponentService**: Manages component operations including validation, storage, and retrieval
- **Business Rules**: Enforces rules such as version management and component validation
- **Transaction Management**: Ensures data consistency during operations

#### 2.3.3 Repository Layer

The repository layer manages data access and persistence. It includes:

- **ComponentRepository**: JPA repository for component entity operations
- **Data Access Logic**: Queries and operations for component data

#### 2.3.4 Database Layer

The database layer stores the component data. It includes:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores component metadata and binary content
- **Schema Design**: Optimized for component storage and retrieval
- **Migrations**: Managed through Flyway for schema evolution

## 3. Data Model

### 3.1 Component Entity

The core entity in the system is the Component, which represents a component specification package:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        +String id
        +String name
        +String version
        +String description
        +byte[] packageContent
        +LocalDateTime publicationTimestamp
        +LocalDateTime updateTimestamp
    }
```

### 3.2 Database Schema

The database schema is designed to efficiently store and retrieve component packages:

```sql
CREATE TABLE components (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    version VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    package_content BYTEA NOT NULL,
    publication_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    update_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_components_name ON components(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_components_name_version ON components(name, version);
```

## 4. API Design

### 4.1 RESTful Endpoints

The API follows RESTful principles with the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                      | Description                           |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| POST   | /api/components               | Upload a component                    |
| GET    | /api/components/download      | Download a specific component version |
| GET    | /api/components               | List all components                   |
| GET    | /api/components/versions      | List versions of a specific component |

### 4.2 Request/Response Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] -->|1. POST /api/components| B[Upload Component]
    A -->|2. GET /api/components/download| C[Download Component]
    A -->|3. GET /api/components| D[List Components]
    A -->|4. GET /api/components/versions| E[List Component Versions]
    
    B -->|201 Created| F[Component Uploaded]
    B -->|400 Bad Request| G[Invalid Request]
    B -->|500 Server Error| H[Upload Failed]
    
    C -->|200 OK| I[Component Downloaded]
    C -->|404 Not Found| J[Component Not Found]
    C -->|500 Server Error| K[Download Failed]
    
    D -->|200 OK| L[Component List]
    D -->|500 Server Error| M[List Failed]
    
    E -->|200 OK| N[Version List]
    E -->|404 Not Found| O[Component Not Found]
    E -->|500 Server Error| P[List Failed]
```

## 5. Storage Strategy

### 5.1 Binary Storage

Component packages (ZIP files) are stored directly in the database as binary data (BYTEA type in PostgreSQL). This approach was chosen for the MVP for simplicity and ease of implementation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Component Package] -->|Stored as| B[Binary Data]
    B -->|Persisted in| C[PostgreSQL BYTEA Column]
    C -->|Part of| D[Component Entity]
```

### 5.2 Considerations

- **Advantages**:
  - Simplified architecture (no separate file storage system)
  - Transactional consistency with metadata
  - Easier backup and recovery

- **Limitations**:
  - Database size growth with large packages
  - Potential performance impact with many large packages

### 5.3 Future Enhancements

For future versions, alternative storage strategies could be considered:
- File system storage with database metadata
- Object storage (S3, etc.) for larger scale deployments

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Current Implementation

The MVP focuses on core functionality and includes basic security measures:
