# Authentication and Authorization Component

## Overview

The Authentication and Authorization component manages user identity verification and access control within the Specky repository system. It handles OAuth 2.0 integration with multiple identity providers, manages authentication tokens, and enforces permission-based access to repository resources. This component ensures that users can securely access the system and that they can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

## Core Functionality

- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Multiple identity provider integration (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control
- Permission enforcement
- API security

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: OAuth Authentication

- Use Case: A user initiates authentication with an OAuth provider
  - Rule: OAuth provider options must be presented to the user
  - Rule: The user must be redirected to the selected provider's authentication page
  - Rule: OAuth callback with authorization code must be handled
  - Rule: Authorization code must be exchanged for access token
  - Rule: User profile information must be retrieved from the provider
  - Rule: Local user record must be created or updated

- Use Case: A system validates an authentication token
  - Rule: Token signature must be verified
  - Rule: Token expiration must be checked
  - Rule: Token claims must be validated
  - Rule: Associated user information must be retrieved
  - Rule: Token refresh must be handled when needed

- Use Case: A user logs out from the system
  - Rule: Current authentication tokens must be invalidated
  - Rule: Session information must be removed
  - Rule: The user must be redirected to appropriate post-logout page
  - Rule: Single sign-out must be handled if applicable

### Feature: Authorization Management

- Use Case: A system checks if a user can perform an action
  - Rule: User's roles and permissions must be retrieved
  - Rule: Permission requirements for the action must be evaluated
  - Rule: Role-based access control rules must be applied
  - Rule: Resource ownership must be considered in permission checks
  - Rule: Authorization decisions must be logged for audit purposes

- Use Case: An administrator manages user roles
  - Rule: Role assignment must be allowed based on administrator permissions
  - Rule: Role changes must be validated against system constraints
  - Rule: User role information in the database must be updated
  - Rule: Role changes must be applied immediately to active sessions
  - Rule: Affected users must be notified of role changes

- Use Case: A system manages resource ownership
  - Rule: Ownership must be assigned when resources are created
  - Rule: Ownership must be verified for protected operations
  - Rule: Ownership transfer between users must be supported
  - Rule: Orphaned resources must be handled when users are removed
  - Rule: Team/group ownership models must be supported

## Data Management

### Authentication Data

The component stores the following information:
- OAuth provider configurations
- Authentication token secrets and keys
- Token blacklist for revoked tokens
- Authentication logs and history
- OAuth state parameters for security

### Authorization Data

The component maintains:
- User roles and permissions
- Role definitions and permission mappings
- Resource ownership records
- Access control policies
- Authorization audit logs

## Integration Points

- Integrates with external OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- Interfaces with User Management for user profile information
- Provides authentication services to all other components
- Provides authorization services to all other components
- Interfaces with API Gateway for request authentication

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle OAuth provider outages
- Manage authentication timeouts
- Handle token theft or compromise
- Manage permission conflicts
- Handle unauthorized access attempts
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Provide fallback authentication mechanisms
- Handle session expiration gracefully
