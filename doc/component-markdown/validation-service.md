# Validation Service Component

## Overview

The Validation Service component ensures the integrity and correctness of component specifications in the Specky repository. It validates the structure and content of component packages against defined schemas, checks for compliance with Specky standards, and provides detailed validation reports. This component is crucial for maintaining the quality and consistency of component specifications in the repository.

## Core Functionality

- Component package structure validation
- spec.json schema validation
- component.md content validation
- datamodel.json schema validation
- Gherkin feature file validation
- Cross-file consistency checking
- Validation reporting

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: Component Package Validation

- Use Case: A system validates a component package during upload
  - Rule: The package must contain all required files (spec.json, component.md)
  - Rule: Optional files (datamodel.json, tests/*.feature) must be checked
  - Rule: The overall package structure must be valid
  - Rule: No extraneous or potentially harmful files must be included
  - Rule: Package size must be within acceptable limits

- Use Case: A user requests validation of an existing component
  - Rule: The component package must be retrieved from storage
  - Rule: Comprehensive validation checks must be performed
  - Rule: A detailed validation report must be generated
  - Rule: Any issues or warnings must be highlighted
  - Rule: Suggestions for fixing validation issues must be provided

### Feature: File-Specific Validation

- Use Case: A system validates a spec.json file
  - Rule: JSON syntax must be correct
  - Rule: The file must be valid against the spec.json schema
  - Rule: Required fields (name, version, description) must be present
  - Rule: Semantic versioning format must be valid
  - Rule: Dependency references and version ranges must be verified

- Use Case: A system validates a component.md file
  - Rule: Minimum required sections must be present
  - Rule: Markdown syntax must be valid
  - Rule: Component description must be adequate
  - Rule: Links or references must not be broken
  - Rule: The file must comply with best practices

- Use Case: A system validates a datamodel.json file
  - Rule: JSON syntax must be correct
  - Rule: The file must be valid against the datamodel.json schema
  - Rule: Entity definitions and relationships must be checked
  - Rule: Attribute types and constraints must be verified
  - Rule: Referential integrity in relationships must be maintained

- Use Case: A system validates Gherkin feature files
  - Rule: Gherkin syntax must be valid
  - Rule: Feature file structure (Feature, Rule, Example) must be verified
  - Rule: Scenarios must be well-formed
  - Rule: Terminology must be consistent
  - Rule: Files must comply with Gherkin best practices

### Feature: Validation Reporting

- Use Case: A system generates a validation report
  - Rule: Issues must be categorized by severity (error, warning, info)
  - Rule: Clear error messages with line numbers must be provided
  - Rule: Suggestions for resolving issues must be included
  - Rule: Validation results must be summarized
  - Rule: The report must be formatted for both human and machine consumption

- Use Case: A user interprets a validation report
  - Rule: Validation results must be presented in a user-friendly format
  - Rule: Critical issues that must be fixed must be highlighted
  - Rule: Context for each validation rule must be provided
  - Rule: Documentation for validation requirements must be linked
  - Rule: Filtering and sorting of validation results must be allowed

## Data Management

### Validation Data

The component stores the following information:
- Validation schemas for different file types
- Validation rule definitions
- Validation result history
- Common validation issues and solutions
- Validation performance metrics

### Reporting Data

The component maintains:
- Validation report templates
- Historical validation results
- Validation statistics across components
- Trending validation issues
- Validation improvement metrics

## Integration Points

- Interfaces with Component Storage to access component packages
- Provides validation services to other components
- Interfaces with User Management for validation permissions
- Interfaces with Dependency Management for dependency validation

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle malformed component packages
- Manage validation of very large files
- Handle validation schema versioning
- Provide graceful degradation for partial validation
- Manage validation timeouts
- Handle validation during schema transitions
- Support custom validation rules
