I've defined a number of components in the `@doc/component-markdown` directory that I want to convert to Specky component specifications.

First review `@doc/component-markdown/index.md` to get an overview of the components.

Then review the [conversion-guide](./conversion-guide.md) for detailed steps on how to create components.

# Your Task

You should convert the markdown documents to Specky Format one component at a time.

1. [ ] create a step-by-step plan with checkboxes to track your progress in `conversion-plan.md`
2. [ ] convert the components one by one
