Feature: Authentication Token Validation
  As a system component
  I want to validate authentication tokens
  So that I can ensure secure access to protected resources

  Rule: System validates token signature and integrity

    Example: System validates a properly signed token
      Given a user has a valid authentication token
      When a system component receives a request with the token
      Then the system should verify the token's signature
      And the system should confirm the token has not been tampered with
      And the system should allow the request to proceed

    Example: System rejects a token with invalid signature
      Given a user presents a token with an invalid signature
      When a system component receives a request with the token
      Then the system should detect the invalid signature
      And the system should reject the authentication attempt
      And the system should log the security violation

  Rule: System checks token expiration

    Example: System accepts a non-expired token
      Given a user has an authentication token
      And the token has not yet expired
      When a system component validates the token
      Then the system should confirm the token is still valid
      And the system should allow the request to proceed

    Example: System rejects an expired token
      Given a user has an authentication token
      And the token has expired
      When a system component validates the token
      Then the system should detect the expired token
      And the system should reject the authentication attempt
      And the system should return an appropriate error response

  Rule: System validates token claims

    Example: System validates required token claims
      Given a user has an authentication token
      When a system component validates the token
      Then the system should verify all required claims are present
      And the system should verify the claims have valid values
      And the system should allow the request to proceed if all claims are valid

    Example: System rejects a token with missing claims
      Given a user has an authentication token with missing required claims
      When a system component validates the token
      Then the system should detect the missing claims
      And the system should reject the authentication attempt

  Rule: System retrieves associated user information

    Example: System retrieves user information from a valid token
      Given a user has a valid authentication token
      When a system component validates the token
      Then the system should extract the user identifier from the token
      And the system should retrieve the associated user information
      And the system should make the user information available to the request context

  Rule: System handles token refresh

    Example: System refreshes a token that is about to expire
      Given a user has an authentication token that is about to expire
      When the system detects the impending expiration
      Then the system should issue a new token
      And the system should invalidate the old token
      And the system should return the new token to the user

    Example: System handles token refresh request
      Given a user has a valid refresh token
      When the user requests a token refresh
      Then the system should validate the refresh token
      And the system should issue a new access token
      And the system should update token metadata
