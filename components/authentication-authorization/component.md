# Authentication and Authorization Component

## Overview

The Authentication and Authorization component manages user identity verification and access control within the Specky repository system. It handles OAuth 2.0 integration with multiple identity providers, manages authentication tokens, and enforces permission-based access to repository resources. This component ensures that users can securely access the system and that they can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

## Core Functionality

- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Multiple identity provider integration
- Token management
- Role-based access control
- Permission enforcement
- API security

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: OAuth Authentication

- Use Case: A user initiates authentication with an OAuth provider
  - Rule: OAuth provider options should be presented to the user
  - Rule: The user should be redirected to the selected provider's authentication page
  - Rule: OAuth callback with authorization code should be handled
  - Rule: Authorization code should be exchanged for access token
  - Rule: User profile information should be retrieved from the provider
  - Rule: Local user record should be created or updated

- Use Case: A system validates an authentication token
  - Rule: Token signature should be verified
  - Rule: Token expiration should be checked
  - Rule: Token claims should be validated
  - Rule: Associated user information should be retrieved
  - Rule: Token refresh should be handled when needed

- Use Case: A user logs out from the system
  - Rule: Current authentication tokens should be invalidated
  - Rule: Session information should be removed
  - Rule: The user should be redirected to appropriate post-logout page
  - Rule: Single sign-out should be handled if applicable

### Feature: Authorization Management

- Use Case: A system checks if a user can perform an action
  - Rule: User's roles and permissions should be retrieved
  - Rule: Permission requirements for the action should be evaluated
  - Rule: Role-based access control rules should be applied
  - Rule: Resource ownership should be considered in permission checks
  - Rule: Authorization decisions should be logged for audit purposes

- Use Case: An administrator manages user roles
  - Rule: Role assignment should be allowed based on administrator permissions
  - Rule: Role changes should be validated against system constraints
  - Rule: User role information in the database should be updated
  - Rule: Role changes should be applied immediately to active sessions
  - Rule: Affected users should be notified of role changes

- Use Case: A system manages resource ownership
  - Rule: Ownership should be assigned when resources are created
  - Rule: Ownership should be verified for protected operations
  - Rule: Ownership transfer between users should be supported
  - Rule: Orphaned resources should be handled when users are removed
  - Rule: Team/group ownership models should be supported

## Data Management

### Authentication Data

The component should manage the following information:
- OAuth provider configurations
- Authentication token secrets and keys
- Token blacklist for revoked tokens
- Authentication logs and history
- OAuth state parameters for security

### Authorization Data

The component should maintain:
- User roles and permissions
- Role definitions and permission mappings
- Resource ownership records
- Access control policies
- Authorization audit logs

## Integration Points

- Should integrate with external OAuth providers
- Should interface with User Management for user profile information
- Should provide authentication services to all other components
- Should provide authorization services to all other components
- Should interface with API Gateway for request authentication

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Should handle OAuth provider outages
- Should manage authentication timeouts
- Should handle token theft or compromise
- Should manage permission conflicts
- Should handle unauthorized access attempts
- Should implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Should handle session expiration gracefully
