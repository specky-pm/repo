# Component Storage and Retrieval Component

## Overview

The Component Storage and Retrieval component is responsible for managing the storage, versioning, and retrieval of Specky component specifications. It handles the entire lifecycle of component packages, from initial upload to download, including versioning according to semantic versioning principles. This component stores both the metadata and the actual component specification files (as compressed zip archives) in the PostgreSQL database.

## Core Functionality

- Component package upload and storage
- Component metadata extraction and indexing
- Semantic versioning management
- Component retrieval and download
- Component deprecation and unpublishing
- Storage optimization for compressed specification files

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: Component Publishing

- Use Case: A user publishes a new component
  - Rule: Validate the uploaded component package structure
  - Rule: Extract and validate metadata from spec.json
  - Rule: Ensure the component name is unique or the version is new
  - Rule: Store the component package as a compressed zip in the database
  - Rule: Index the component metadata for searching
  - Rule: Associate the component with the publishing user
  - Rule: Notify subscribers about the new component

- Use Case: A user updates an existing component with a new version
  - Rule: Validate semantic versioning rules are followed
  - Rule: Ensure the new version is greater than existing versions
  - Rule: Preserve previous versions while adding the new one
  - Rule: Update component metadata index
  - Rule: Notify users of the component update

### Feature: Component Retrieval

- Use Case: A user downloads a specific component version
  - Rule: Verify user has access to the component
  - Rule: Retrieve the component package from storage
  - Rule: Track the download for statistics
  - Rule: Serve the component as a zip file
  - Rule: Handle concurrent downloads efficiently

- Use Case: A user lists available versions of a component
  - Rule: Retrieve all versions of the specified component
  - Rule: Sort versions according to semantic versioning rules
  - Rule: Indicate deprecated versions
  - Rule: Show relevant metadata for each version

### Feature: Component Lifecycle Management

- Use Case: A user deprecates a component
  - Rule: Verify user has permission to deprecate the component
  - Rule: Mark the component as deprecated in the database
  - Rule: Store deprecation message and timestamp
  - Rule: Allow continued downloads but with deprecation warning
  - Rule: Suggest alternative components if specified

- Use Case: A user unpublishes a component version
  - Rule: Verify user has permission to unpublish
  - Rule: Remove the component version from active listings
  - Rule: Maintain the record for audit purposes
  - Rule: Handle dependent components appropriately
  - Rule: Prevent unpublishing if other components depend on it

## Data Management

### Component Data

The component stores the following information:
- Component unique identifier (UUID)
- Component name (unique within the registry)
- Component version (following semantic versioning)
- Component description
- Owner reference (user ID)
- Full metadata (from spec.json, stored as JSONB)
- Component package content (stored as BYTEA)
- Deprecation status and message
- Publication timestamp
- Update timestamp

### Version History

For each component:
- All published versions
- Changes between versions
- Download statistics per version
- Deprecation status per version

## Integration Points

- Interfaces with User Management for ownership and permissions
- Interfaces with Dependency Management to track component relationships
- Interfaces with Search and Discovery for component indexing
- Interfaces with Validation Service to verify component structure

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle large component packages efficiently
- Manage version conflicts
- Handle database storage constraints
- Manage concurrent uploads/downloads
- Handle corrupted component packages
- Implement recovery mechanisms for failed uploads
- Handle unpublishing of components with dependencies
