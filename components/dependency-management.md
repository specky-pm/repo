# Dependency Management Component

## Overview

The Dependency Management component handles the relationships between different component specifications in the Specky repository. It manages dependency resolution, version compatibility checking, and ensures the integrity of the dependency graph. This component is crucial for enabling users to build complex applications from multiple component specifications while maintaining compatibility.

## Core Functionality

- Dependency declaration and tracking
- Semantic versioning compatibility checking
- Dependency resolution and validation
- Circular dependency detection
- Dependency graph visualization
- Impact analysis for component updates

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: Dependency Declaration and Tracking

- Use Case: A component declares dependencies on other components
  - Rule: Validate dependency declarations in spec.json
  - Rule: Support semantic versioning ranges for dependencies
  - Rule: Store dependency relationships in the database
  - Rule: Differentiate between regular, dev, peer, and optional dependencies
  - Rule: Verify that declared dependencies exist in the repository

- Use Case: A system tracks components that depend on a specific component
  - Rule: Maintain reverse dependency relationships
  - Rule: Update dependency relationships when new versions are published
  - Rule: Provide API to query dependents of a component
  - Rule: Track dependency usage statistics

### Feature: Dependency Resolution

- Use Case: A user resolves dependencies for a component
  - Rule: Resolve semantic version ranges to specific versions
  - Rule: Handle nested dependencies recursively
  - Rule: Detect and resolve version conflicts
  - Rule: Optimize for minimal dependency tree
  - Rule: Support dependency resolution constraints

- Use Case: A system validates dependency compatibility
  - Rule: Check version compatibility according to semver rules
  - Rule: Identify breaking changes between versions
  - Rule: Warn about potentially incompatible dependencies
  - Rule: Validate peer dependency requirements
  - Rule: Report detailed compatibility information

### Feature: Dependency Analysis

- Use Case: A user views the dependency graph for a component
  - Rule: Generate a visual representation of dependencies
  - Rule: Show direct and transitive dependencies
  - Rule: Highlight circular dependencies
  - Rule: Indicate dependency types (regular, dev, peer, optional)
  - Rule: Allow interactive exploration of the dependency graph

- Use Case: A user analyzes the impact of updating a component
  - Rule: Identify all affected dependent components
  - Rule: Assess compatibility risks based on semver rules
  - Rule: Provide detailed impact reports
  - Rule: Suggest version update strategies
  - Rule: Simulate dependency resolution with the update

## Data Management

### Dependency Data

The component stores the following information:
- Component dependency relationships
- Dependency types (regular, dev, peer, optional)
- Version constraints for each dependency
- Reverse dependency mappings
- Dependency resolution history

### Analysis Data

The component maintains:
- Dependency graph structures
- Compatibility matrices between versions
- Impact analysis results
- Common dependency patterns
- Dependency health metrics

## Integration Points

- Interfaces with Component Storage to access component metadata
- Interfaces with Validation Service to verify dependency declarations
- Interfaces with Search and Discovery to provide related component information
- Provides dependency services to other components

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle circular dependencies
- Manage complex version resolution conflicts
- Handle missing or unpublished dependencies
- Manage dependency tree depth limits
- Handle version range incompatibilities
- Provide fallback strategies for unresolvable dependencies
- Detect and report dependency vulnerabilities
