# Dependency Management Component

## Overview

The Dependency Management component handles the relationships between different component specifications in the Specky repository. It manages dependency resolution, version compatibility checking, and ensures the integrity of the dependency graph. This component is crucial for enabling users to build complex applications from multiple component specifications while maintaining compatibility.

## Core Functionality

- Dependency declaration and tracking
- Semantic versioning compatibility checking
- Dependency resolution and validation
- Circular dependency detection
- Dependency graph visualization
- Impact analysis for component updates

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: Dependency Declaration and Tracking

- Use Case: A component declares dependencies on other components
  - Rule: Dependency declarations in spec.json must be validated
  - Rule: Semantic versioning ranges for dependencies must be supported
  - Rule: Dependency relationships must be stored in the database
  - Rule: Regular, dev, peer, and optional dependencies must be differentiated
  - Rule: Declared dependencies must exist in the repository

- Use Case: A system tracks components that depend on a specific component
  - Rule: Reverse dependency relationships must be maintained
  - Rule: Dependency relationships must be updated when new versions are published
  - Rule: API to query dependents of a component must be provided
  - Rule: Dependency usage statistics must be tracked

### Feature: Dependency Resolution

- Use Case: A user resolves dependencies for a component
  - Rule: Semantic version ranges must be resolved to specific versions
  - Rule: Nested dependencies must be handled recursively
  - Rule: Version conflicts must be detected and resolved
  - Rule: The dependency tree must be optimized for minimal size
  - Rule: Dependency resolution constraints must be supported

- Use Case: A system validates dependency compatibility
  - Rule: Version compatibility must be checked according to semver rules
  - Rule: Breaking changes between versions must be identified
  - Rule: Warnings about potentially incompatible dependencies must be provided
  - Rule: Peer dependency requirements must be validated
  - Rule: Detailed compatibility information must be reported

### Feature: Dependency Analysis

- Use Case: A user views the dependency graph for a component
  - Rule: A visual representation of dependencies must be generated
  - Rule: Direct and transitive dependencies must be shown
  - Rule: Circular dependencies must be highlighted
  - Rule: Dependency types (regular, dev, peer, optional) must be indicated
  - Rule: Interactive exploration of the dependency graph must be allowed

- Use Case: A user analyzes the impact of updating a component
  - Rule: All affected dependent components must be identified
  - Rule: Compatibility risks based on semver rules must be assessed
  - Rule: Detailed impact reports must be provided
  - Rule: Version update strategies must be suggested
  - Rule: Dependency resolution with the update must be simulated

## Data Management

### Dependency Data

The component stores the following information:
- Component dependency relationships
- Dependency types (regular, dev, peer, optional)
- Version constraints for each dependency
- Reverse dependency mappings
- Dependency resolution history

### Analysis Data

The component maintains:
- Dependency graph structures
- Compatibility matrices between versions
- Impact analysis results
- Common dependency patterns
- Dependency health metrics

## Integration Points

- Interfaces with Component Storage to access component metadata
- Interfaces with Validation Service to verify dependency declarations
- Interfaces with Search and Discovery to provide related component information
- Provides dependency services to other components

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle circular dependencies
- Manage complex version resolution conflicts
- Handle missing or unpublished dependencies
- Manage dependency tree depth limits
- Handle version range incompatibilities
- Provide fallback strategies for unresolvable dependencies
- Detect and report dependency vulnerabilities
