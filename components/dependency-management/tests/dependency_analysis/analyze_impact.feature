Feature: Impact Analysis
  As a component developer
  I want to analyze the impact of updating a component
  So that I can understand how changes will affect dependent components

  Rule: All affected dependent components must be identified

    Example: System identifies components affected by an update
      Given a component "A" with version "1.0.0"
      And components "B", "C", and "D" depend on component "A"
      When a user analyzes the impact of updating component "A" to version "2.0.0"
      Then the system should identify "B", "C", and "D" as affected components
      And the impact analysis should include direct and transitive dependents

    Example: System categorizes affected components by impact level
      Given a component "A" with version "1.0.0"
      And various components depend on component "A" with different version constraints
      When a user analyzes the impact of updating component "A" to version "1.1.0"
      Then the system should categorize dependents by impact level (high, medium, low)
      And the categorization should be based on version constraints and semver rules

  Rule: Compatibility risks based on semver rules must be assessed

    Example: System assesses compatibility risks for a major version update
      Given a component "A" with version "1.0.0"
      And components depend on component "A" with various version constraints
      When a user analyzes the impact of updating component "A" to version "2.0.0"
      Then the system should assess compatibility risks based on semver rules
      And the system should identify components with high compatibility risk

    Example: System assesses compatibility risks for a minor version update
      Given a component "A" with version "1.0.0"
      And components depend on component "A" with various version constraints
      When a user analyzes the impact of updating component "A" to version "1.1.0"
      Then the system should assess compatibility risks based on semver rules
      And the system should identify components that might be affected despite semver rules

  Rule: Detailed impact reports must be provided

    Example: System generates a detailed impact report
      Given a component "A" with version "1.0.0"
      And components depend on component "A"
      When a user analyzes the impact of updating component "A" to version "2.0.0"
      Then the system should generate a detailed impact report
      And the report should include affected components
      And the report should include compatibility risk assessments
      And the report should include recommended actions

    Example: System provides impact visualization
      Given a component "A" with version "1.0.0"
      And components depend on component "A"
      When a user analyzes the impact of updating component "A" to version "2.0.0"
      Then the system should provide a visual representation of the impact
      And the visualization should highlight affected dependency paths
      And the visualization should use color coding to indicate risk levels

  Rule: Version update strategies must be suggested

    Example: System suggests version update strategies
      Given a component "A" with version "1.0.0"
      And components depend on component "A"
      When a user analyzes the impact of updating component "A"
      Then the system should suggest version update strategies
      And the strategies should include recommendations for dependent components
      And the strategies should consider minimizing breaking changes
