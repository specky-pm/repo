# Component Storage and Retrieval Component

## Overview

The Component Storage and Retrieval component is responsible for managing the storage, versioning, and retrieval of 
Specky component specifications. It handles the entire lifecycle of component packages, from initial upload to download, 
including versioning according to semantic versioning principles. This component manages both the metadata and the 
actual component specification files.

## Core Functionality

- Component package upload and storage
- Component metadata extraction and indexing
- Semantic versioning management
- Component retrieval and download

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: Component Publishing

- Use Case: A user publishes a component
  - Rule: The component package must be stored in the system
  - Rule: The component metadata must be indexed for searching
  - Rule: Uploading a component with the same name and version as an existing component overwrites the existing component


### Feature: Component Retrieval

- Use Case: A user downloads a specific component version
  - Rule: The component package must be retrieved from storage
  - Rule: The component must be served as a zip file

## Data Management

### Component Data

The component should manage the following information:
- Component name & version (following semantic versioning)
  - name & version represent the primary key and should be unique
- Component description
- Full metadata (from spec.json)
- Component package content
- Publication timestamp
- Update timestamp

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Should handle large component packages efficiently
- Should manage version conflicts (overwrite existing version)
- Should handle storage constraints
- Should manage concurrent uploads/downloads
- Should handle corrupted component packages
- Should implement recovery mechanisms for failed uploads
