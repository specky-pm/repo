# Component Storage and Retrieval Component

## Overview

The Component Storage and Retrieval component is responsible for managing the storage, versioning, and retrieval of Specky component specifications. It handles the entire lifecycle of component packages, from initial upload to download, including versioning according to semantic versioning principles. This component manages both the metadata and the actual component specification files.

## Core Functionality

- Component package upload and storage
- Component metadata extraction and indexing
- Semantic versioning management
- Component retrieval and download
- Component deprecation and unpublishing
- Storage optimization for component specification files

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: Component Publishing

- Use Case: A user publishes a new component
  - Rule: The uploaded component package structure must be valid
  - Rule: Metadata from spec.json must be extracted and validated
  - Rule: The component name must be unique or the version must be new
  - Rule: The component package must be stored in the system
  - Rule: The component metadata must be indexed for searching
  - Rule: The component must be associated with the publishing user
  - Rule: Subscribers must be notified about the new component

- Use Case: A user updates an existing component with a new version
  - Rule: Semantic versioning rules must be followed
  - Rule: The new version must be greater than existing versions
  - Rule: Previous versions must be preserved while adding the new one
  - Rule: Component metadata index must be updated
  - Rule: Users must be notified of the component update

### Feature: Component Retrieval

- Use Case: A user downloads a specific component version
  - Rule: The user must have access to the component
  - Rule: The component package must be retrieved from storage
  - Rule: The download must be tracked for statistics
  - Rule: The component must be served as a zip file
  - Rule: Concurrent downloads must be handled efficiently

- Use Case: A user lists available versions of a component
  - Rule: All versions of the specified component must be retrieved
  - Rule: Versions must be sorted according to semantic versioning rules
  - Rule: Deprecated versions must be indicated
  - Rule: Relevant metadata for each version must be shown

### Feature: Component Lifecycle Management

- Use Case: A user deprecates a component
  - Rule: The user must have permission to deprecate the component
  - Rule: The component must be marked as deprecated in the system
  - Rule: Deprecation message and timestamp must be stored
  - Rule: Continued downloads must be allowed but with deprecation warning
  - Rule: Alternative components must be suggested if specified

- Use Case: A user unpublishes a component version
  - Rule: The user must have permission to unpublish
  - Rule: The component version must be removed from active listings
  - Rule: The record must be maintained for audit purposes
  - Rule: Dependent components must be handled appropriately
  - Rule: Unpublishing must be prevented if other components depend on it

## Data Management

### Component Data

The component should manage the following information:
- A unique identifier for each component
- Component name (unique within the registry)
- Component version (following semantic versioning)
- Component description
- Owner reference (user ID)
- Full metadata (from spec.json)
- Component package content
- Deprecation status and message
- Publication timestamp
- Update timestamp

### Version History

For each component, the system should track:
- All published versions
- Changes between versions
- Download statistics per version
- Deprecation status per version

## Integration Points

- Should interface with User Management for ownership and permissions
- Should interface with Dependency Management to track component relationships
- Should interface with Search and Discovery for component indexing
- Should interface with Validation Service to verify component structure

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Should handle large component packages efficiently
- Should manage version conflicts
- Should handle storage constraints
- Should manage concurrent uploads/downloads
- Should handle corrupted component packages
- Should implement recovery mechanisms for failed uploads
- Should handle unpublishing of components with dependencies
