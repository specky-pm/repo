# User Management Component

## Overview

The User Management component handles all aspects of user accounts within the Specky repository system. It manages user registration, profile information, and tracks user activities such as publishing components and download history. This component integrates with OAuth 2.0 providers to authenticate users and maintains user-specific data.

## Core Functionality

- User registration and authentication via OAuth 2.0
- User profile management
- User role management (regular users, publishers, administrators)
- User activity tracking
- User permissions enforcement

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: User Registration and Authentication

- Use Case: A user registers using an OAuth provider
  - Rule: The system must support multiple OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
  - Rule: Basic profile information must be extracted from the OAuth provider
  - Rule: A new user record must be created if the user doesn't exist
  - Rule: User information must be updated if the user already exists
  - Rule: Access tokens for API authentication must be generated and provided

- Use Case: A user logs in to the system
  - Rule: OAuth credentials must be validated
  - Rule: JWT tokens must be issued for authenticated sessions
  - Rule: Login activity must be tracked
  - Rule: Tokens must be refreshed when needed

- Use Case: A user logs out of the system
  - Rule: Current session tokens must be invalidated
  - Rule: All session-related data must be cleared

### Feature: User Profile Management

- Use Case: A user views their profile information
  - Rule: User details (username, email, etc.) must be displayed
  - Rule: The user's published components must be shown
  - Rule: The user's download history must be shown

- Use Case: A user updates their profile information
  - Rule: Updated information must be validated
  - Rule: The profile in the database must be updated
  - Rule: A history of profile changes must be maintained

### Feature: User Role Management

- Use Case: An administrator assigns roles to users
  - Rule: The system must support different role types (user, publisher, admin)
  - Rule: Role assignment permissions must be validated
  - Rule: User roles in the database must be updated
  - Rule: Users must be notified of role changes

- Use Case: A system checks user permissions
  - Rule: The user must have the appropriate role for the requested action
  - Rule: Access must be denied if permissions are insufficient
  - Rule: Permission check failures must be logged

## Data Management

### User Data

The component stores the following user information:
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Username (unique)
- Email address
- OAuth provider information
- OAuth provider ID
- User roles and permissions
- Registration date
- Last login timestamp
- Account status

### User Activity Data

The component tracks:
- Login history
- Component publishing activity
- Component download history
- Administrative actions

## Integration Points

- Integrates with OAuth 2.0 providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- Provides authentication services to other components
- Interfaces with Component Storage for publishing permissions
- Interfaces with Download Service for tracking download history

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle OAuth provider unavailability
- Manage conflicting user information from different OAuth providers
- Handle account merging when a user authenticates with multiple providers
- Manage account deactivation and deletion
- Handle permission escalation attempts
