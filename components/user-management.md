# User Management Component

## Overview

The User Management component handles all aspects of user accounts within the Specky repository system. It manages user registration, profile information, and tracks user activities such as publishing components and download history. This component integrates with OAuth 2.0 providers to authenticate users and maintains user-specific data.

## Core Functionality

- User registration and authentication via OAuth 2.0
- User profile management
- User role management (regular users, publishers, administrators)
- User activity tracking
- User permissions enforcement

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: User Registration and Authentication

- Use Case: A user registers using an OAuth provider
  - Rule: Support multiple OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
  - Rule: Extract basic profile information from OAuth provider
  - Rule: Create a new user record if the user doesn't exist
  - Rule: Update user information if the user already exists
  - Rule: Generate and provide access tokens for API authentication

- Use Case: A user logs in to the system
  - Rule: Validate OAuth credentials
  - Rule: Issue JWT tokens for authenticated sessions
  - Rule: Track login activity
  - Rule: Refresh tokens when needed

- Use Case: A user logs out of the system
  - Rule: Invalidate current session tokens
  - Rule: Clear any session-related data

### Feature: User Profile Management

- Use Case: A user views their profile information
  - Rule: Display user details (username, email, etc.)
  - Rule: Show user's published components
  - Rule: Show user's download history

- Use Case: A user updates their profile information
  - Rule: Validate updated information
  - Rule: Update profile in the database
  - Rule: Maintain history of profile changes

### Feature: User Role Management

- Use Case: An administrator assigns roles to users
  - Rule: Support different role types (user, publisher, admin)

## Data Management

### User Data

The component stores the following user information:
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Username (unique)

- OAuth provider information
- OAuth provider ID
- User roles and permissions
- Registration date
- Last login timestamp
- Account status

### User Activity Data

- Login history
- Component publishing activity
- Component download history
- Administrative actions

## Integration Points

- Integrates with OAuth 2.0 providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- Provides authentication services to other components
- Interfaces with Component Storage for publishing permissions
- Interfaces with Download Service for tracking download history

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle OAuth provider unavailability
- Manage conflicting user information from different OAuth providers
- Handle account merging when a user authenticates with multiple providers
- Manage account deactivation and deletion
- Handle permission escalation attempts
