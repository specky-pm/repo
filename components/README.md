# Specky Repository Component Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for the components that make up the Specky Repository system. These specifications are designed to be converted into Specky component format and implemented using Java and Spring Boot.

## Directory Contents

- **[index.md](./index.md)**: Overview of all components and their relationships
- **[conversion-guide.md](./conversion-guide.md)**: Guide for converting these specifications to Specky format
- **Component Specifications**:
  - [user-management.md](./user-management.md): User account and profile management
  - [component-storage.md](./component-storage.md): Storage and retrieval of component packages
  - [search-discovery.md](./search-discovery.md): Search and discovery functionality
  - [dependency-management.md](./dependency-management.md): Component dependency handling
  - [authentication-authorization.md](./authentication-authorization.md): Authentication and access control
  - [validation-service.md](./validation-service.md): Component validation

## Purpose

These specifications serve as the foundation for implementing a repository for Specky component specifications. The repository will:

1. Allow users to publish, update, and manage component specifications
2. Enable searching and discovering component specifications
3. Handle dependencies between components
4. Validate component specifications against schemas
5. Provide secure access through OAuth 2.0 authentication

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will use:

- **Java**: Primary programming language
- **Spring Boot**: Application framework
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing both metadata and component packages
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authentication with multiple identity providers
- **REST API**: Interface for client applications

## How to Use These Specifications

1. **Review the specifications**: Understand the requirements for each component
2. **Follow the conversion guide**: Convert these specifications to Specky format
3. **Implement the components**: Use Java and Spring Boot to implement each component
4. **Integrate the components**: Combine the components into a cohesive system
5. **Expose the REST API**: Create endpoints for client applications

## Next Steps

1. Convert one component at a time to Specky format
2. Implement a minimal viable product (MVP) with core functionality
3. Expand the implementation to include all components
4. Test the system with real component specifications
5. Deploy the repository for public use
