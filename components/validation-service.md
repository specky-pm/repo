# Validation Service Component

## Overview

The Validation Service component ensures the integrity and correctness of component specifications in the Specky repository. It validates the structure and content of component packages against defined schemas, checks for compliance with Specky standards, and provides detailed validation reports. This component is crucial for maintaining the quality and consistency of component specifications in the repository.

## Core Functionality

- Component package structure validation
- spec.json schema validation
- component.md content validation
- datamodel.json schema validation
- Gherkin feature file validation
- Cross-file consistency checking
- Validation reporting

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: Component Package Validation

- Use Case: A system validates a component package during upload
  - Rule: Verify the package contains all required files (spec.json, component.md)
  - Rule: Check for optional files (datamodel.json, tests/*.feature)
  - Rule: Validate the overall package structure
  - Rule: Ensure no extraneous or potentially harmful files are included
  - Rule: Verify package size is within acceptable limits

- Use Case: A user requests validation of an existing component
  - Rule: Retrieve the component package from storage
  - Rule: Perform comprehensive validation checks
  - Rule: Generate a detailed validation report
  - Rule: Highlight any issues or warnings
  - Rule: Provide suggestions for fixing validation issues

### Feature: File-Specific Validation

- Use Case: A system validates a spec.json file
  - Rule: Verify JSON syntax correctness
  - Rule: Validate against the spec.json schema
  - Rule: Check required fields (name, version, description)
  - Rule: Validate semantic versioning format
  - Rule: Verify dependency references and version ranges

- Use Case: A system validates a component.md file
  - Rule: Check for minimum required sections
  - Rule: Verify markdown syntax
  - Rule: Ensure adequate component description
  - Rule: Check for broken links or references
  - Rule: Validate against best practices

- Use Case: A system validates a datamodel.json file
  - Rule: Verify JSON syntax correctness
  - Rule: Validate against the datamodel.json schema
  - Rule: Check entity definitions and relationships
  - Rule: Verify attribute types and constraints
  - Rule: Ensure referential integrity in relationships

- Use Case: A system validates Gherkin feature files
  - Rule: Check Gherkin syntax
  - Rule: Verify feature file structure (Feature, Rule, Example)
  - Rule: Ensure scenarios are well-formed
  - Rule: Check for consistent terminology
  - Rule: Validate against Gherkin best practices

### Feature: Validation Reporting

- Use Case: A system generates a validation report
  - Rule: Categorize issues by severity (error, warning, info)
  - Rule: Provide clear error messages with line numbers
  - Rule: Include suggestions for resolving issues
  - Rule: Summarize validation results
  - Rule: Format report for both human and machine consumption

- Use Case: A user interprets a validation report
  - Rule: Present validation results in a user-friendly format
  - Rule: Highlight critical issues that must be fixed
  - Rule: Provide context for each validation rule
  - Rule: Link to documentation for validation requirements
  - Rule: Allow filtering and sorting of validation results

## Data Management

### Validation Data

The component stores the following information:
- Validation schemas for different file types
- Validation rule definitions
- Validation result history
- Common validation issues and solutions
- Validation performance metrics

### Reporting Data

The component maintains:
- Validation report templates
- Historical validation results
- Validation statistics across components
- Trending validation issues
- Validation improvement metrics

## Integration Points

- Interfaces with Component Storage to access component packages
- Provides validation services to other components
- Interfaces with User Management for validation permissions
- Interfaces with Dependency Management for dependency validation

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle malformed component packages
- Manage validation of very large files
- Handle validation schema versioning
- Provide graceful degradation for partial validation
- Manage validation timeouts
- Handle validation during schema transitions
- Support custom validation rules
