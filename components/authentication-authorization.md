# Authentication and Authorization Component

## Overview

The Authentication and Authorization component manages user identity verification and access control within the Specky repository system. It handles OAuth 2.0 integration with multiple identity providers, manages authentication tokens, and enforces permission-based access to repository resources. This component ensures that users can securely access the system and that they can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

## Core Functionality

- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Multiple identity provider integration (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control
- Permission enforcement
- API security

## Features & Use Cases

### Feature: OAuth Authentication

- Use Case: A user initiates authentication with an OAuth provider
  - Rule: Present OAuth provider options to the user
  - Rule: Redirect to the selected provider's authentication page
  - Rule: Handle OAuth callback with authorization code
  - Rule: Exchange authorization code for access token
  - Rule: Retrieve user profile information from the provider
  - Rule: Create or update local user record

- Use Case: A system validates an authentication token
  - Rule: Verify token signature
  - Rule: Check token expiration
  - Rule: Validate token claims
  - Rule: Retrieve associated user information
  - Rule: Handle token refresh when needed

- Use Case: A user logs out from the system
  - Rule: Invalidate current authentication tokens
  - Rule: Remove session information
  - Rule: Redirect user to appropriate post-logout page
  - Rule: Handle single sign-out if applicable

### Feature: Authorization Management

- Use Case: A system checks if a user can perform an action
  - Rule: Retrieve user's roles and permissions
  - Rule: Evaluate permission requirements for the action
  - Rule: Apply role-based access control rules
  - Rule: Consider resource ownership in permission checks
  - Rule: Log authorization decisions for audit purposes

- Use Case: An administrator manages user roles
  - Rule: Allow role assignment based on administrator permissions
  - Rule: Validate role changes against system constraints
  - Rule: Update user role information in the database
  - Rule: Apply role changes immediately to active sessions
  - Rule: Notify affected users of role changes

- Use Case: A system manages resource ownership
  - Rule: Assign ownership when resources are created
  - Rule: Verify ownership for protected operations
  - Rule: Support ownership transfer between users
  - Rule: Handle orphaned resources when users are removed
  - Rule: Support team/group ownership models

## Data Management

### Authentication Data

The component stores the following information:
- OAuth provider configurations
- Authentication token secrets and keys
- Token blacklist for revoked tokens
- Authentication logs and history
- OAuth state parameters for security

### Authorization Data

The component maintains:
- User roles and permissions
- Role definitions and permission mappings
- Resource ownership records
- Access control policies
- Authorization audit logs

## Integration Points

- Integrates with external OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- Interfaces with User Management for user profile information
- Provides authentication services to all other components
- Provides authorization services to all other components
- Interfaces with API Gateway for request authentication

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle OAuth provider outages
- Manage authentication timeouts
- Handle token theft or compromise
- Manage permission conflicts
- Handle unauthorized access attempts
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Provide fallback authentication mechanisms
- Handle session expiration gracefully
