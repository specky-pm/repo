# Application Planning Instructions

## Your Task

Your task is to create an initial plan for the implementation of a new application.

You should review the relevant documents (outlined later) and create a detailed step-by-step plan for implementing the 
application. Your plan will then be used by the developers to implement the application.

## Relevant Documents

### Component Specifications

In the components directory, you will find a series of components which will be used as the foundation of the 
application. Each subdirectory in the componets directory outline detailed requirements for each component. 

```
./components/
├── component-name/
│   ├── spec.json
│   ├── component.md
│   ├── datamodel.json
│   └── tests/
│       └── *.feature
```

Each component consists of:

1. **spec.json**: Contains metadata about the component
2. **component.md**: Describes the component in detail
3. **datamodel.json** (optional): Models entities that the component relies on
4. **tests/*.feature** (optional): Gherkin feature specifications for testing

### Application Architecture

In the `architecture.md` file you'll find an overview of the desired architecture for the application. Please use
this when writing your plan and ensure you include this information in the final document.

## Expected Output

Please create a document called `implementation-plan.md` which includes:
- an overview of the system architecture including languages, frameworks and other relevant information
- a step-by-step plan with checkbox notation so we can track our progress e.g. `[ ]`
